## How we deploy this site

We deploy this site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) which supports 
Tokio as part of their awesome open source program.

This doc is for the folks on the team who have access, so we can remember
how to do stuff.  If there is something wrong with the deploy, please find
us on [tokio-docs discord].
